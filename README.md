# Katas
In this repository I will collect code Katas found on the Internet and my variants. 

I will add for each code Kata: origin, description (as v0), sources if present and at least one my solution.

Specially for the v1/v2 katas' solutions do not expect high level solution, I'm at the beginning.

All the repositories and sites where I found the Katas will be also reported at the end fo the file.

The Katas are organized by topic and by name.

If you want all the Katas see `all-katas.md`.
